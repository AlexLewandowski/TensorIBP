This code implements "accelerated" Gibbs sampling [1] for the
linear-Gaussian infinite latent feature model (aka Indian Buffet
Process or IBP) [2].

This code also allows the use real-valued latent features [3], using a
slice sampler for compatibility with the accelerated Gibbs scheme.

New features are sampled using a Metropolis-Hastings scheme [4].


EXAMPLE USAGE



ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thanks to Finale Doshi-Velez for making her MATLAB code available, and
for answering detailed questions about inference.

The modified slice sampler for real-valued latent features was the
result of discussion with David Knowles.
